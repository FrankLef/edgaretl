Download XBRL files from EDGAR. This is done in 2 steps:

* Download the rss feed providing the specs to retrieve the xbrl files.
* Download the xbrl using the specs provided by the rss feed.

The rss files are located at <https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/monthly> and give the url addresses of the xbrl files at EDGAR.
